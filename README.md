In this project, I selected lyrics from the song "Nonstop" from my favorite musical Hamilton to form the core of the design, using the text to create a silhouette of the iconic Hamilton figure. The silhouette’s resolution and the arrangement of the text evolve over time, which can express the tireless and ambitious characteristics of Hamilton.

In the background, I used the musical’s central quote, "I am not throwin' away my shot," as raindrops to symbolize Hamilton's determination to seize every opportunity, no matter the challenges. Also, the color of the text is influenced by the original image’s RGB values, adding an extra layer of visual interest and complexity to the image.

(And I'm really curious about the process behind Evan Roth's work.)
